# Return of the One Bit

3D rendering showcase of dithering shaders inspired by the game *Return of the Obra Dinn* by Lucas Pope, which features two-color dithering graphics.

## Dithering

On a black-and-white two color system, shades of grey can be represented in a pointillistic matter by juxtaposition of black and white pixels. This is a technique originating from newspapers and the printing industry.
